# Serve PQMs using Python

This folder contains a simple script to load the SSR PQM and make predictions with it in production. This is the same model as in the node.js case. Simply paste this code in your flask or any other Python web server backends.

## Try on Google Colab
- Visit https://colab.research.google.com/github/linkedin/performance-quality-models/blob/main/ssr-mobile-web/mweb-jan-2022-v1/python-example/ssr_mobile_web_model_demo.ipynb
- Follow the code step by step with inline documentation. The behavior of the model can be experienced interactively using a form based UI at the end.

## Try in your own environment

We recommend using Google colab to try the models as it requires no additional setup. To run this on your local laptop

- Clone the repo
- Install Python 3
- `pip install jupyter`
- `jupyter notebook`
- Open ssr-mobile-web/mweb-jan-2022-v1/python-example/ssr_mobile_web_model_demo.ipynb in the Jupyter UI
